HexChat JS
----------

Javascript interface using Spidermonkey.

It's my first time using javascript and c++ so forgive my mistakes ;)

Consider this an alpha, everything works well enough to do useful things with it
but the api is very likely to change and some bugs still exist.

Done:

- Load/unload/reload/autoloading scripts
- Interpreter via */js*
- Runtime per script
- Full coverage of hexchat api

Todo:

- Error checking, testing, etc
- Objectify all the things?
- Improve build system
- Windows project
